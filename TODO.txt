TODO:

GUI menu
-- add or remove volumes / meshes to menu as added / removed
-- ask to replace or merge (when appropriate)
-- options: opacity, thresholding (checkbox and slider), visible (checkbox)
-- some indication that a folder is empty / inaccessible (invisible?)

Google closure (instead of jquery)
-- sliders
-- index box
-- drag and drop
-- menu

small remaining problems
-- loading vol -> vol : scrolling doesn't match right object
-- rename from ygr to xyz
-- move from html and css into pure js?
-- gui menu: don't call onclick method when dragging
-- how much overhead is associated with having all objects in the renderer, but invisible vs being added/removed?

misc features
-- be able to drag and drop a 2D renderer into a new viewer
-- Sunil's progress bar?
-- show slice number out of total?
-- volume thresholding

load files from XNAT!




thinking about the transfer of data (Steve)
-- slice by slice
-- begin in middle, work outwards (so something is there)
-- pre-cache needed data
-- -- large, hi-res = slow
-- -- improve user experience

overlays: same patient, is in same space?, ...

drop in mrb files - Ron
-- http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3

be able to scan a single slice from…
-- different patients
-- across time

scan through time, slice is an average of people, certain attribute highlighted (ie white matter hyperintensity)
