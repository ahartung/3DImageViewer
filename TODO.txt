TODO:

dimensions of files are inconsistent w/ xtk
some nrrd files: x = dim[2], y = dim[1], z = dim[0]
other nrrd files: x = dim[0], y = dim[1], z = dim[2]
other nrrd files: x = dim[2], y = dim[0], z = dim[1]

Google closure (instead of jquery)
-- sliders (opacities, theshold)
-- -- don't want it to drag menu around... stop propagation
-- radio buttons
-- checkboxes
-- all listeners

-- load files from XNAT
-- -- REST API

small remaining problems
-- loading vol -> vol : scrolling doesn't match right object
-- gui menu: don't call onclick method when dragging
-- load vol, load mesh, vol opacity to 0, mesh is visible, render, opacity to 0, hard to see mesh
-- give the menu boundaries: don't drag out of viewer
-- animated zippy makes an extra div elt
-- shift and move mouse: doesn't update sliders or boxes

misc features
-- make range of threshold slider different color
-- move from html and css into pure js?
-- be able to drag and drop a 2D renderer into a new viewer?
-- Sunil's progress bar?
-- show slice number out of total?
-- be able to change size of 2D planes?

future problems
-- prompt to replace or merge (ie dropped different patient data, replace?)
-- add meshes / volumes to same space (same orientation, same origin, same scale)
-- adding multiple objects at once messes with 2D renderers
-- how much overhead is associated with having all objects in the renderer, but invisible vs being added/removed?








thinking about the transfer of data (Steve)
-- slice by slice
-- begin in middle, work outwards (so something is there)
-- pre-cache needed data
-- -- large, hi-res = slow
-- -- improve user experience

overlays: same patient, is in same space?, ...

be able to scan a single slice from…
-- different patients
-- across time

scan through time, slice is an average of people, certain attribute highlighted (ie white matter hyperintensity)
