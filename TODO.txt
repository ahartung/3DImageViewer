TODO:

-- load files from XNAT
-- -- REST API

future problems
-- prompt to replace or merge (ie dropped different patient data, replace?)
-- add meshes / volumes to same space (same orientation, same origin, same scale)
-- how much overhead is associated with having all objects in the renderer, but invisible vs being added/removed?



small problems
-- radio button deselects on viewer move
-- opacity slider for volumes doesn't move w/ clicking (threshold does)
-- scrolling/sliders match direction of Sunil's (ie scroll up always moves thumb to the right)
-- destroy 3D renderers when 2D is dropped on top or viewer is contracted by a row/col (viewer manager) (to save resources?)






thinking about the transfer of data (Steve)
-- slice by slice
-- begin in middle, work outwards (so something is there)
-- pre-cache needed data
-- -- large, hi-res = slow
-- -- improve user experience

overlays: same patient, is in same space?, ...

drop in mrb files - Ron
-- http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3

be able to scan a single slice from…
-- different patients
-- across time

scan through time, slice is an average of people, certain attribute highlighted (ie white matter hyperintensity)
